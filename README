The online environment for designing the open and vendor-neutral PulseWaves.org standard for geo-referenced full waveform LiDAR. The format is LAS compatible but instead of storing discrete returns, it stores geo-referenced laser pulses and their waveforms. It is meant to cater both topo and bathy LiDAR.
